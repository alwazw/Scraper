# Human README

## Project Overview
This project is an automated Lead Generation & Aggregation Pipeline. It scrapes business information from Google Maps, visits their websites to find contact details (emails, social media links), and aggregates everything into a master database.

## How to Run
1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Note: requirements.txt will be generated as we progress).
3.  Run the pipeline: `python main.py` (To be implemented).

## Output
The final output will be located in `final_delivery/master_leads.db`. You can export this to CSV using any SQLite viewer or the provided export script (TBD).
